GameDev.net Collaborative Coding Horror 2013
============================================

This is a totally unofficial repository, tracking the history of [The Great GameDev.net Collaborative Coding Horror](http://www.gamedev.net/topic/649258-the-great-gdnet-collaborative-coding-horror-experiment/), 2013.

I will be making two branches, c++ and web, where the two programs will live separately. I'll be using GameDev.net usernames as author names in commits; if you'd like that to change (for example, using your Github name+email), just let me know in the GameDev.net forums (or via PM).
