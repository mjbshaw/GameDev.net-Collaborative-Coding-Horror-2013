GameDev.net Collaborative Coding Horror 2013
============================================

This is a totally unofficial repository, tracking the history of [The Great GameDev.net Collaborative Coding Horror](http://www.gamedev.net/topic/649258-the-great-gdnet-collaborative-coding-horror-experiment/), 2013.

I will be making two branches, [c++](https://github.com/mjbshaw/GameDev.net-Collaborative-Coding-Horror-2013/tree/c++) and [web](https://github.com/mjbshaw/GameDev.net-Collaborative-Coding-Horror-2013/tree/web), where the two programs will live separately. I'll be using GameDev.net usernames as author names in commits; if you'd like that to change (for example, using your Github name+email), just let me know in the GameDev.net forums (or via PM).

[The C++ thread can be found here](http://www.gamedev.net/topic/649605-coding-horror-experiment-in-c/)

[The HTML5 thread can be found here](http://www.gamedev.net/topic/649606-coding-horror-experiment-in-html-5/)
